PACKAGE_NAME flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
PACKAGE_DESCR FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified,
PACKAGE_DESCR FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless.  "Free" means that the
PACKAGE_DESCR specification of the stream format is in the public domain, and that
PACKAGE_DESCR neither the FLAC format nor any of the implemented encoding/decoding
PACKAGE_DESCR methods are covered by any patent. It also means that the sources for
PACKAGE_DESCR libFLAC and libFLAC++ are available under the LGPL and the sources for
PACKAGE_DESCR flac, metaflac, and the plugins are available under the GPL.
PACKAGE_DESCR FLAC was developed by Josh Coalson.
