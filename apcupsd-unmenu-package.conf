PACKAGE_NAME apcupsd - A daemon for controlling APC UPS devices
PACKAGE_DESCR Apcupsd can be used for power management and controlling most 
PACKAGE_DESCR of APC's UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. <br>Apcupsd works with most of APC's 
PACKAGE_DESCR Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such as Back-UPS and BackUPS-Office.
PACKAGE_DESCR
PACKAGE_DESCR <br><br>Note: If you elect to not power down the UPS, the server may not detect when power is eventually restored, and will not start until you press its power button. 
PACKAGE_DESCR In addition, the UPS will run until its batteries are depleted, rather than attempt to conserve its batteries.
PACKAGE_DESCR For this reason, most users will want to set <b>Power Down UPS after shutdown?</b> = <b>YES</b> <br>
PACKAGE_DESCR If <b>Power Down UPS after shutdown?</b> = <b>NO</b>, the UPS will not power down.  You only want this if the UPS is 
PACKAGE_DESCR also powering other equipment that must stay powered after the unRAID server is shut down.

PACKAGE_VARIABLE Use Serial Port?(YES/NO)||vDEVICE=NO||If set to NO, a connection via USB cable is used.  If YES, a connection via SERIAL cable will be used.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Cable Type:(smart/usb/dumb)||vCABLETYPE=smart||Use "smart" for APC UPS, "usb" for some other brands, "dumb" for others with appropriate cable to serial port.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Battery Level||vBATTERYLEVEL=10||Shutdown will occur when percentage charge remaining is less than this level.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Minutes Remaining||vMINUTES=5||Shutdown will occur when remaining runtime reaches this value.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Total Seconds Outage||vTIMEOUT=300||If outage (in seconds) exceeds this value, a shutdown will occur.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Power Down UPS after shutdown?(YES/NO)||vUPS_KILL=YES||If YES the UPS will power itself off after the server is powered down.  This allows it to save its batteries.  If NO, the UPS will not power down.  You only want this if the UPS is powering other equipment that must stay powered.
