PACKAGE_NAME ntfs-3g - NTFS read/write filesystem driver
PACKAGE_DESCR The 2009.4.4 version <b>ntfs-3g</b> driver adds to unRAID the ability to read and write NTFS file systems. 
PACKAGE_DESCR The built-in NTFS driver is read-only.<br> 
PACKAGE_DESCR The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available NTFS driver
PACKAGE_DESCR for Linux with read and write support.  It provides safe and fast
PACKAGE_DESCR handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 and
PACKAGE_DESCR Windows Vista file systems.  Most POSIX file system operations are
PACKAGE_DESCR supported, with the exception of full file ownership and access
PACKAGE_DESCR rights support.
PACKAGE_DESCR <br>It is not necessary to install the ntfs-3g driver if all you will be doing is reading from nfts file-systems.  This driver is only needed if you are writing to ntfs file systems.
PACKAGE_DESCR <br><br><font color=blue><b>This is a pre-compiled slackware package.  You do not need to install a "C" compiler to compile it on your server.  It is not the very latest version of ntfs-3g, but the most recent pre-compiled Slackware package I could locate. I will work perfectly for any read-only access and most write access of an NTFS file-system.  You will need to see the release notes to determine changes on subsequent versions.</font></b></br>
