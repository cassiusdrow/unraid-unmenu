PACKAGE_NAME <b>apcupsd</b> - APC UPS Daemon
PACKAGE_DESCR Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of APC's 
PACKAGE_DESCR UPS models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with most of 
PACKAGE_DESCR APC's Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such 
PACKAGE_DESCR as Back-UPS, and BackUPS-Office. 
PACKAGE_DESCR During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users about the power 
PACKAGE_DESCR failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not restored, a 
PACKAGE_DESCR system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted, a timeout 
PACKAGE_DESCR (seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC 
PACKAGE_DESCR calculations determined by power consumption rates.
PACKAGE_DESCR
PACKAGE_DESCR <br><ul><li>You must have installed and configured a "mail" command on your unRAID server to receive ups related e-mail notices.</li>
PACKAGE_DESCR <li>Make sure you have your router/switch connected to an UPS as well, otherwise the e-mail notices that apcupsd generates may not be sent as your unRAID box wouldn't be able to reach the internet.</li>
PACKAGE_DESCR <b><font color=blue>You must also install the "Clean Powerdown" package for this program to be able to shut the unRAID server down cleanly.<br>
PACKAGE_DESCR This package, Mail and the 'Clean Powerdown' package should all be set to re-install on reboot.</font></b></ul>

PACKAGE_DEPENDENCIES /usr/bin/mail, /sbin/powerdown
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Use Serial Port?(YES/NO/network_master:port)||vDEVICE=NO||If set to NO, a connection via USB cable is used.  If YES, a connection via SERIAL cable will be used. If set to anything else, that port will be used.  <br>(Set to remote_master:port to network slave off another server running apcupsd. <br> Example: if the master is "tower" then set this field to </b>tower:3551</b> )
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Cable Type:(smart/usb/dumb/ether)||vCABLETYPE=smart||Use "smart" for APC UPS, "usb" for some other brands, "dumb" for others with appropriate cable to serial port, "ether" to slave off of apcupsd running on another server.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Battery Level||vBATTERYLEVEL=5||Shutdown will occur when percentage charge remaining is less than this level.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Minutes Remaining||vMINUTES=5||Shutdown will occur when remaining runtime reaches this value.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Total Seconds Outage||vTIMEOUT=0||If you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable this timer by setting it to zero. That way, you UPS will continue on batteries until either the % charge remaing drops to or below BATTERYLEVEL, or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below MINUTES. If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than the time you know you can run on batteries.
PACKAGE_VARIABLE Power Down UPS after shutdown?(YES/NO)||vUPS_KILL=NO||If YES the UPS will power itself off after the server is powered down.  This allows it to save its batteries.  If NO, the UPS will not power down.  You only want this if the UPS is powering other equipment that must stay powered.
